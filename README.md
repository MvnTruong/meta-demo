# Meta Poster Demo

## Full Stack Developer technical test Requirements

Build an application using JavaScript and/or PHP which has the following features:

- 3 button components which trigger API GET requests
- A component that renders the API results in a presentable way

Clicking each button should fetch data using their own API URL (provided below). Once the data is fetched, you will need to store it in a local database.

If a record has a poster, you should store the poster in its own table and create a relevant relation to the record.
